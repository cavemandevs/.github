## What we do
We're the developers behind [Caveman Linux](https://github.com/cavemandevs/caveman-linux), a Linux distribution aimed at beginners to Linux, and people who are beginners to technology.

## Our Philosophy
We believe that computing should be accessible to everyone, and also that anyone should be able to work on their computer from day one. We aim to build software that is designed to assist beginners and computer literate people in maximizing their potential and helping them do the things they love, but on Linux!.

## Current Projects
Currently, we're working on Caveman Linux, an Arch Linux based distribution aimed at beginners.
