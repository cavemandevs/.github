## Hello!
You've reached the official GitHub page for Caveman Software, where we develop cutting edge technologies to improve user experiences all around the world.

### What we do
We're the developers behind [Caveman Linux](https://github.com/cavemandevs/caveman-linux), a Linux distribution aimed at beginners to Linux, and people who are beginners to technology.

### Our Philosophy
We believe that computing should be accessible to everyone, and also that anyone should be able to work on their computer from day one. We aim to build software that is designed to assist beginners and computer illiterate people in maximizing their potential and helping them do the things they love. We strive to provide a unique user experience where you can use your technology to your maximum potential. We will always look in the perspective of the user, and we value community suggestions and improvements.

### We <3 Open Source!
We promise that we will always have open code, and we will contribute to the Open Source initiative as much as we can. Open Source software helps everyone build a better tomorrow, and it helps everyone contribute to build a better product, [including you!](https://github.com/cavemandevs/caveman-linux/pulls)

### Making Contributions
Before making contributions (thank you for considering this!), we kindly ask that you read the code of conduct. This is usually in the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file in the repository.

### Current Projects
