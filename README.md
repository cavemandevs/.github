# <div align="center"> The Caveman Project </div>

## What we do
We're the developers behind [Caveman Linux](https://github.com/cavemandevs/caveman-linux), a Linux distribution aimed at beginners to Linux, and people who are beginners to technology.

## Our Philosophy
We believe that computing should be accessible to everyone, and we believe that you should be able to interact well with the computer from day one. We aim to build software that is designed to assist beginners and less computer literate people from maximizing their potential and helping them do the things they love.

## Current Projects
Currently, we're working on Caveman Linux, an Arch Linux based distribution aimed at beginners.
